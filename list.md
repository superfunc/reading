| The Little Schemer | Friedman, Felleisen | 1/1/17 | Really fun little book. I like the idea of programming as a conversation with the runtime environment. The only non-lisp thing to achieve this I can recall is Idris(http://idris-lang.org).

| Effective Python | Slatkin | 1/8/17 | Useful, brisk read. Good for reference as well.|
| Type Driven Development | Brady | 4/22/2017 | Eye-opening. Surprisingly more approachable than most Haskell books. |

| 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know | Various | 5/1/2017 | Brisk read; useful tidbits. |

| The Little Schemer | Friedman, Felleisen | 1/1/17 | Really fun little book. I like the idea of programming as a conversation with the runtime environment. The only non-lisp thing to achieve this I can recall is Idris(http://idris-lang.org).
| A Byte of VIM | Swaroop | 1/3/17 | Just a nice little refresher. Great intro for new users. |
| Effective Python | Slatkin | 1/8/17 | Useful, brisk read. Good for reference as well.|
| Land of Lisp | Barski | TBD | |
| The Seasoned Schemer | Friedman, Felleisen | TBD | |
| Practical Common Lisp | Seibel | TBD | |
| Let Over Lambda | Hoyte | TBD | |
